# StaSiS-Net: a stacked and siamese stereo network for depth reconstruction in modern 3D laparoscopy.


This repository contains all the supplementary material related to the paper: StaSiS-Net: a stacked and siamese stereo network 
for depth estimation in mod-ern 3D laparoscopy - Bardozzo F., Collins T., Hostettler A., Forgione A. and Tagliaferri R.

Additional samples and examples from our simulated dataset of internal surfaces are linked [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12Q3qrlFGaBd6R2wcISjx-XgN9t5WwXfe).  Further, it is provided the 3D model with camera intrinsics used for simulation.  

For a visual quality assessment, on this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TiX3eXXbcbQ) 
some 3D reconstructions on simulated and real videos are provided.
